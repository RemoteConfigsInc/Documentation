##### [API Documentation](./README.md)

### Authentication

In order to use the API of RemoteConfigs you will need to generate an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests. The API Key is to be sent in the header of your request with the key `apikey`.

e.g. `"apikey" : "RC_9e0bbb4cada16f688da56506b561d1e5928e0c6c"`

An API Key can be generated from the API key section found in the left sidebar of your RemoteConfigs Dashboard. (*You will need to be logged in to RemoteConfigs*)
